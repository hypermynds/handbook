# Hypermynds overview

## What Hypermynds does

Hypermynds is a technology company operating in the energy sector.

We build and run software platforms that help energy companies:

- trade electricity and gas on regulated markets  
- optimize their portfolios and assets (including BESS)  
- manage contracts, customers and operational workflows  
- and comply with regulatory and financial requirements  

Our customers are professional operators: utilities, traders, suppliers, asset owners and financial institutions.  
They rely on our systems to make daily decisions that have real financial and operational impact.

Hypermynds is not a generic software house: we are a **vertical energy-tech company**.

## Our products

Hypermynds develops several platforms, but not all of them play the same role.

At the core of the company there is a family of products dedicated to the **energy market**.  
These systems are what most customers interact with and what generate most of the company’s revenue.

### Energy platforms

**Domino.** Our trading and optimization platform. Domino connects directly to energy market infrastructures (such as GME and continuous intraday markets) and is used to:

- place and manage orders
- run algorithmic trading strategies
- manage portfolios and positions
- optimize assets such as batteries (BESS)

**Flashlight.** The portfolio and settlement platform. Flashlight is used to:

- analyze traded volumes
- reconcile market results
- manage imbalances, margins and settlements
- and support post-trade operations

**Prism.** The platform used for managing energy communities, contracts and regulatory data, including CER and related processes.

**Stream.** The acquisition and operations portal used by energy suppliers and partners to:

- acquire customers
- manage contracts and documents
- and exchange data with banks and external systems

Together, these platforms form an integrated ecosystem for operating in the energy market.

### Other Hypermynds projects

Hypermynds also develops other platforms outside the core energy business.

**Atom** and **Opus** are examples of projects built using the same technological stack and engineering approach, but targeting different business domains.

These projects are part of Hypermynds’ broader strategy, but they are distinct from the energy-market products described above.

## How Hypermynds makes money

Hypermynds operates a mixed model based on:

- software subscriptions  
- setup and onboarding fees  
- and, in some cases, project-based development  

We invest heavily in building reusable platforms.  
This means that the quality, stability and maintainability of the codebase directly affect the company’s long-term success.

Every hour of work, every line of code and every operational decision contributes to the economic sustainability of the company.

## Why our software is critical

Much of our software interacts with:

- regulated energy markets  
- financial systems  
- and customer production environments  

This has important consequences:

- bugs can cause real financial losses  
- outages can block customer operations  
- security issues can have legal and regulatory impact  

For this reason, we place strong emphasis on:

- correctness  
- security  
- traceability  
- and controlled deployments  

Working at Hypermynds means taking responsibility for systems that matter.

## What kind of company this is

Hypermynds is:

- not a consultancy  
- not body rental  
- and not a generic SaaS  

We build **products**, not just projects.

This means that we think in terms of:

- long-term architecture  
- product quality  
- scalability  
- and sustainability  

We work with customers, but we do not outsource our technical or strategic decisions.

## What we expect from people

We expect everyone at Hypermynds to act with:

- ownership of their work  
- attention to detail  
- and respect for colleagues and customers  

People here are expected to:

- communicate clearly  
- ask questions when something is unclear  
- and take responsibility for the systems they work on  

We value collaboration, but we also value individual accountability.  
Everyone contributes to the reliability, reputation and success of the company.
