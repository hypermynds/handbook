# Time report

Hypermynds operates multiple products and client projects at the same time.  
Tracking how time is spent is essential to:

- correctly invoice customers  
- understand product profitability  
- account for internal R&D activities  
- and comply with tax and regulatory requirements  

For this reason, **accurate time reporting is not optional**.

We use [Clockify](https://clockify.me/) to track working time.  
You will receive an invitation to the Hypermynds workspace from your manager.

## How to fill your timesheet

Open the [Clockify timesheet](https://clockify.me/timesheet) and record your work using:

- one entry per project or activity  
- the total time spent (hours and minutes)  
- a short description when useful  

```{r clockify_dashboard, fig.align = 'center', echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/time_report/clockify_dashboard.png")
```

You can also specify start and end times and add a description:
```{r clockify_edit_form, fig.align = 'center', echo=FALSE, out.width='30%'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/time_report/clockify_edit_form.png")
```

## When to report time

Time must be entered:

* **at the end of each working day**, or
* **at the latest by the end of the week**

Leaving timesheets empty or filling them retroactively from memory leads to incorrect data and is not acceptable.

## Projects and special activities

You will find dedicated projects in Clockify for:

* vacation and time off
* sick leave
* internal meetings and administration

If you are unsure which project to use, or if a project is missing, ask your manager **before** logging time.

Accurate time reporting protects both you and the company.
