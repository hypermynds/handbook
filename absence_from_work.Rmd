# Absence from work

Absences from work can occur mainly for two reasons:

- planned time off (vacation or permits)  
- illness  

Hypermynds manages absences in accordance with Italian labor law and the applicable collective agreement (CCNL).

## Paid time off (vacation and permits)

Your employment contract specifies:

- your annual vacation entitlement  
- your annual paid permits (ROL or similar)  

These amounts are accrued progressively during the year, in line with Italian law.

All time off must be recorded in [Clockify](https://clockify.me/timesheet) so that:

- payroll is calculated correctly  
- accrued and used time is tracked accurately  

Vacation and permits should be requested **in advance** and agreed with your manager, taking into account:

- team workload  
- project deadlines  
- business needs  

To request time off, send an email to **hr@hypermynds.com** with:

- **Subject**: Vacation request / Permit request  
- **Dates or hours requested**  
- **Type of leave** (vacation or permit)  

Your manager will be included in the approval process.

The request is considered approved only after confirmation by your manager.

## Sick leave

If you feel unwell and cannot work, inform your manager as soon as possible.

In Italy, sick leave is managed through the National Institute for Social Security (INPS).  
Your doctor will issue a **digital medical certificate** and provide you with a **protocol number**.

You must communicate this protocol number to Hypermynds so the company can properly register the sick leave with INPS.

Do not come to the office or work remotely if you are medically unfit to work.
