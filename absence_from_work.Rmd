# Absence from work

It may happen that you have to take some time off basically for two reasons:
either because you have taken vacation or because you don't feel well.

## Paid Time Off

Your Hypermynds employment contract includes a number of hours per year that you
can take as paid leave. In particular, these are:

- 26 days of vacation and
- 32 hours of permits

We ask you to [track your time off](https://clockify.me/timesheet) so we can
properly compensate you for unsued time. Your vacation time is prorated your
first year working @Hypermynds but, if you need more time off, you can go
negative with basicly no effects.

In principle, it is possible to request vacations and permits at any time of the
year, compatibly with the workload and deadlines of your team and always sharing
it in advance with your manager.

To formalize the request it is necessary to send an email to your manager using
the following scheme:

- **Subject**: Vacation Request / Permit Request
- **Text**: Indicate exactly the days/hours you intend to request
- **Reason**: A concise description of the reason for the request

## Sick days

In case you feel unwell please let your manager know as soon as possible so that
your workload can be redistributed among other colleagues.

Usually your doctor decides how many days you need to get back into shape. In
this case it is mandatory to ask your doctor for the **digital certificate** and
communicate the protocol number to your manager. This way, Hypermynds will be
able to open a file for you with the National Institute for Social Security
(INPS).
