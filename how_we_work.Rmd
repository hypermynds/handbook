# How we work

This chapter describes how work is organized at Hypermynds and how decisions, development and operations are handled.

The goal is not bureaucracy, but clarity: when everyone understands how things work, we can move faster and with fewer mistakes.

## Ownership and responsibility

At Hypermynds, every piece of work has an owner.

The owner is responsible for:

- understanding what needs to be done
- ensuring it is done correctly
- and communicating clearly about its status

Ownership does not mean working alone.  
It means being accountable for the outcome.

## Products before projects

We build and operate long-lived products, not just one-off projects.

This means that:

- code is written to be maintained
- shortcuts are avoided when they create long-term problems
- and decisions are evaluated based on their impact over time

Customer requests are important, but they are always balanced against the integrity and evolution of the product.

## Communication

We use different tools for different purposes:

- **Slack** for day-to-day communication, coordination and quick questions
- **Email** for formal requests, approvals and external communication
- **Issues and Pull Requests** for technical work

Important decisions must be documented in writing, either in:

- a GitHub issue
- or a Pull Request
- or an internal document

Verbal agreements or Slack messages are not enough for decisions that affect products or customers.

## Working hours and presence

Hypermynds works as a highly collaborative team.  
For this reason, having overlapping working hours and predictable availability is important.

The standard working schedule is:

- **Office days**: Monday to Thursday  
- **Remote day**: Friday  

- **Working hours**: 09:00 – 18:00  
- **Lunch break**: 13:00 – 14:00  

To allow some flexibility, the daily start time can vary within a defined window:

- You may start at **08:30** and finish at **17:30**  
- You may start at **09:00** and finish at **18:00**  
- In exceptional situations (transport delays, personal issues, etc.) you may start as late as **09:30** and finish at **18:30**

This flexibility is designed to absorb real-life variability while still keeping the team aligned.

Arrivals later than 09:30 are treated as partial absences and are recorded as paid permits, with a granularity of **15 minutes** (for example, arriving at 09:31 is recorded as 09:45).

This system is not meant to control people, but to ensure fairness, transparency and correct payroll and leave accounting for everyone.

## Remote work and availability

Remote work at Hypermynds is based on trust and autonomy.

At the same time, working remotely requires ensuring availability and responsiveness so that the team can collaborate effectively.

When working remotely, you are expected to:

- be reachable via **Slack** during working hours
- join calls or meetings when needed
- respond within a reasonable time to messages from your team or manager

Remote work does not mean working in isolation.
If you need to be temporarily unavailable (appointments, personal matters, etc.), communicate it in advance to your team or manager.

This ensures that remote work remains effective and aligned with team needs.

## Development workflow

All development work follows the same basic process:

1. A task or problem is defined in a GitHub issue
2. Work is done on a dedicated branch
3. Changes are submitted via a Pull Request
4. The Pull Request is reviewed before being merged

Direct commits to main or production branches are not allowed.

## Code reviews

Code reviews are not a formality.
They exist to:

- catch bugs
- improve design
- share knowledge
- and keep quality high

Reviews should be:

- constructive
- focused on the code
- and aimed at improving the final result

If something is unclear, ask.
If something is wrong, say it.

## Environments and deployments

Hypermynds operates multiple environments (development, staging and production).

Production systems are used by customers and must be treated with care.

Only authorized people can deploy to production, and:

- changes must be traceable
- and, when possible, reversible

Never experiment directly on production systems.

## Incidents and problems

When something goes wrong in production:

- fixing the problem is the first priority
- understanding why it happened comes next

There is no blame for honest mistakes.
There is responsibility for learning from them and preventing them from happening again.

## Working with customers

Customers trust Hypermynds with critical parts of their business.

This means:

- be precise in what you say
- do not promise what you are not sure can be delivered
- and escalate problems early rather than hiding them

It is better to say “we need to investigate” than to give a wrong answer.

## Continuous improvement

Hypermynds is always evolving.

If you see:

- a process that does not work
- documentation that is missing
- or a recurring problem

you are encouraged to propose improvements.

Making the company work better is part of everyone’s job.
