# The Hypermynds Employee Handbook {-}

This handbook is designed to contain all the answers to questions a new employee
at Hypermynds may have. At the moment the document is still work in progress,
therefore the contents will be added on a case-by-case basis over the next few
weeks.

The topics that will be covered are many, from the more technical ones related
to the initial setup of the laptop to those more related to life in the company.

Of course new contributions to the handbook are warmly welcomed: if you think
that something is missing you can try to write a section by your own and propose
a [Pull Request](https://github.com/hypermynds/handbook/pulls) or suggest the
missing content opening an
[Issue](https://github.com/hypermynds/handbook/issues) on GitHub.
