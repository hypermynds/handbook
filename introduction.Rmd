# Introduction

Hypermynds is a technology company operating in the energy sector.

We design and run software systems that help energy companies trade, forecast, manage risk and operate on regulated electricity and gas markets. Our platforms are used every day to take decisions that have real financial and operational impact.

This means that what we build is not “just software”:
it directly affects how our customers interact with markets, regulators and large volumes of money.

For this reason, working at Hypermynds requires a mix of:

- technical rigor  
- attention to detail  
- responsibility  
- and the ability to collaborate in complex environments  

At the same time, we strongly believe that people do their best work when they feel respected, trusted and supported by their colleagues. We want Hypermynds to be a place where:

- problems are discussed openly  
- help is always available  
- and knowledge is shared instead of being hoarded  

You will work with people who care deeply about what they do and who expect the same level of commitment and professionalism from everyone on the team.

Our office and our remote-work setup are designed to support this way of working: focused when needed, collaborative when useful, and human at all times.
