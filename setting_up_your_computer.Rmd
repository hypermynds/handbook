    knitr::include_graphics("figures/setting_up_your_computer/security_general_tab.png")
    ```

## How to install the software using Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is the easiest way to install the software and
keep it updated. To install Homebrew execute the following command in the
Terminal and follow the instructions:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Once that Homebrew has been installed close the Terminal and open it again, you
can check if everything is ok executing the command `brew --version`, you will
see something like this:

```
> brew --version
Homebrew 3.3.9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               â”‚
Homebrew/homebrew-core (git revision 8600fa3966f; last commit 2021-12-21)
Homebrew/homebrew-cask (git revision 17172f9d63; last commit 2021-12-21)
```

To complete the Homebrew setup you should install also
[`brew-cask-update`](https://github.com/buo/homebrew-cask-upgrade) executing
the command:

```bash
brew tap buo/cask-upgrade
```

### Keep everything updated

Homebrew handles the updates of installed softwares by itself, you don't need
to download or reinstall the software checking if a new version of some package
has been released. To keep everything updated you should follow the steps:

1. command `brew update` download the updated list of the packages provided by
   Homebrew;
2. command `brew outdated` gives you the list of outdated packages, so you can
   check if something will break your work;
3. command `brew upgrade` updates all the outdated packages installing the new
   available versions;
4. command `brew cu` updates all the cask packages (usually ignored by the
   `upgrade` command).

### Essential commands

`brew doctor`

:   Check your system for potential problems.

`brew info <package>`

:   Show summary of information about a package. 

`brew install [--cask] <package>`

:   Install a package or cask.

`brew list`

:   List all installed packages and casks.

`brew outdated`

:   List installed casks and packages that have an updated version available.

`brew reinstall [--cask] <package>`

:   Uninstall and then reinstall a package or cask.

`brew search <text>`

:   Perform a substring search of cask and package names.

`brew uninstall <package>`

:   Uninstall a package or cask.

`brew update`

:   Fetch the newest version of Homebrew and all packages.

`brew upgrade [<package>]`

:   Upgrade outdated casks and outdated packages. If cask or package are
specified, upgrade only the given cask or package.

## Setting up the R development environment

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) and
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) can be installed using
Homebrew:

```
> brew install --cask r
...
> brew install --cask rstudio
...
```

RStudio is installed in your `/Applications` directory, to check if everything
has been setup correctly it is enough to open it.

### Set your Github Personal Access Token

To interact with private repositories or avoid the GitHub rate limits for
unauthenticated users you have to create a GitHub Personal Access Token:

Open R or RStudio and execute the following commands:

```r
install.packages('usethis')
usethis::create_github_token()
```

R will open your browser and redirect it to the page for creating the token
(probably it prompt for your password), set the name of the token to "R" and
the expiration time to 90 days (tokens without expiration are unsecure), leave
everything else untouched and click the button "Create token" at the and of the
page.

```{r github_create_new_pat, fig.align = 'center', echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/setting_up_your_computer/github_create_a_new_pat.png")
```

GitHub will show you the new created token (the ugly string with green
background), copy it and close the page.

```{r github_new_pat, fig.align = 'center', echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/setting_up_your_computer/github_new_pat.png")
```

Execute the following R command:

```r
usethis::edit_r_eviron()
```

Now the file `~/.Renviron` will be opened with your preferred editor, now you
can add (or update) the line:

```
GITHUB_PAT=<PUT HERE THE GITHUB TOKEN AND NOT THESE MEANINGLESS WORDS>
```

For security reasons it is a good idea to change the permissions of
`~/.Renviron` executing the following command in the Terminal:

```bash
chmod 0600 ~/.Renviron
```
