# Security and compliance

Hypermynds operates in regulated energy and financial environments.  
Our systems handle:

- market orders  
- customer data  
- financial information  
- authentication credentials  
- and regulatory processes  

Security is therefore not optional: it is part of everyone’s job.

## Access control

Access to Hypermynds systems is granted on a **need-to-know basis**.

You will receive access only to:

- the services  
- environments  
- and data  

that are required for your role.

Do not:

- share accounts  
- share credentials  
- or use someone else’s access  

If you need additional access, request it through your manager or HR.

## Authentication and identity

Hypermynds uses centralized identity management (e.g. Auth0, Google Workspace and other identity providers).

You must:

- use strong, unique passwords  
- enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever available  
- and keep your account recovery information up to date  

Never disable MFA on company systems.

## Secrets and credentials

All secrets must be stored in **Bitwarden** or in approved secure systems.

This includes:

- passwords  
- API tokens  
- SSH keys  
- certificates  
- and recovery keys  

Secrets must **never** be:

- sent via email  
- shared on Slack  
- stored in code repositories  
- or saved in plain text files  

If you believe a secret has been exposed, report it immediately.

## Customer and market data

Data from customers, energy markets and partners must be handled with care.

Do not:

- copy customer data to personal devices  
- upload it to external services  
- or share it outside Hypermynds  

Use only approved tools and environments to access and process sensitive data.

## Production systems

Production environments contain live customer and market data.

Only authorized personnel may access or modify production systems.

Do not:

- run experiments  
- test scripts  
- or ad-hoc changes  

directly in production.

All changes must follow the defined deployment and approval process.

## Certificates and market credentials

Hypermynds uses digital certificates and cryptographic credentials to access energy market platforms (such as GME).

These credentials:

- are legally binding  
- can place real market orders  
- and may have regulatory impact  

They must be:

- stored securely  
- accessed only when required  
- and never copied or shared  

Misuse of these credentials can have serious financial and legal consequences.

## Compliance and audits

Hypermynds may be subject to:

- customer audits  
- regulatory requirements  
- and internal controls  

You may be asked to:

- document processes  
- provide logs  
- or explain how systems work  

This is normal in a regulated environment.  
Always provide accurate and complete information.

## Reporting issues

If you notice:

- a security weakness
- a data leak  
- suspicious activity  
- or a process that puts compliance at risk  

report it immediately to your manager or to HR.

Early reporting protects both you and the company.
